T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK1=The Bringers and Liberi were once teacher and student. But they are no longer on friendly terms. Now, they have become enemies.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK10=The Bringers were deadset on their path. If the Liberi wanted to stand in their way, they were going to run them over.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK11=The Liberi were the young students of the Bringers, trained in their tactics and skills and also gifted access to their advanced suit technology.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK12=The Liberi were found by the Bringers years after they gained their freedom. They wanted to expand their scope of influence and build a bigger team.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK13=The Liberi believed in their teachers and were quick learners. Within a few years, they have become almost as formidable as the masters themselves.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK14=The Liberi believed in improving the world. This meant changing humanity in their eyes. They thought that's what the Bringers wanted.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK15=Killing ate away at the Liberi's souls. They couldn't do it anymore. They wanted to not just eliminate evil, but to make people and humanity better.
T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK16=The Bringer, Dee, took a liking to Morana, a young, intelligent woman who would become her student. They shared a respect for the role of death in life.

T_22_D_RAMPAGE_TASK4=The Liberi eventually found the Bringers way of doing things too harsh. Too much killing and not bringing enough good. This eventually broke them apart.

T_26_E_MVP_EMERGENCY=Emergency
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC1=Shirou gets out of bed to a welcoming warm and sunny day. He stretches thinking, what does today have in store for him?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC10=Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa. Shirou lets his vector go to deal with the gang members that appeared in front of him. He zoomed out of the tunnel only to be stopped by an armored vehicle.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC11=All his escape routes were blocked - except for one. Shirou revs his engine and rushes into the enemy circle and tosses a grenade. That will give an opening, but where to next?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC12=Shirou has found himself in an arena. He tried to deliver the armor to Kla and get out of this situation. But the armor won't come off and now they want him to fight. And the enemy looks formidable. He winds up for the biggest punch of his life.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC13=It was a day like any other. On a delivery, he met another riding a motorcycle. A young woman with long eyelashes, intense eyes and a leather outfit. Her momentary gaze latched onto him like a fishhook.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC14=It was another day, driving through the city. Going down a narrow alley and another motorbike was coming up fast, they both swerved and went on their ways. All he saw was a flash of silver hair.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC15=A delivery had gone wrong, his deliveree was strangling him for no reason. No worries, he's been in worse situations. *Pop* The man yelled and ran back into his house. It was a helmeted woman, she got on her motorcycle and zoomed off. She looked familiar.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC2=Shirou's mood is high walking about town but is interrupted when a delivery drone drops a package in front of his face. Does Shirou accept the delivery job?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC3=Shirou opened up the courier package. It was addressed to some guy named Kla, he wondered who he was.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC4=Shirou walks down the street and comes upon a statue of a famous man from the city. Who was he and how did he get his fame?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC5=All of a sudden wind blew and clouds filled the sky, putting everything in shadow. He turned a corner to escape the weather only to find a motorcycle gang waiting for him.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC6=Shirou moved quickly, rushed down the stairs as the thugs chased after him. They must want his package. What was in there that was so valuable?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC7=The guys are like a bad flu, he just couldn't shake them. He's found a hiding spot and can't run forever. They'll find him soon. How was he going to get out of this?
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC8=Shirou opens the package, anything useful would help. But what he saw, was not what he expected - armor. He puts it on, and a surge of energy courses through him.
T_26_E_MVP_EVENT_DESC9=Shirou runs to find his goal. His beloved motorcycle. The wind streams against his face as he races through the city, the gang on his tail. He's not sure he can outrun them. He'd better create some chaos.

Rampage was not always known as Rampage. It started out as Project Harmony, which was created to help rebuild a war-torn city. Tyson was the original director of the project, but when Horizon wanted to move it to a dangerous direction, he killed the project and united the soldiers who were originally part of the program. Now, under him, all generations of Rampage answer to his wisdom and protection, so they built him a suit fit for a leader.

T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_1=Today is my day dedicated for drumming practice. No sweat, no bets!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_10=Hope there's a drumline in your holiday!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_11=Holidays are a time to share music with each other!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_12=New year... New cheer!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_13=I hope we still have a chance to perform one last time!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_14=Wow! That stage looks rockin'! I can't wait to get up there!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_15=My pride and joy... a drumkit. Can you smell the vibrations the drums are giving off? Feel the tingles from the cymbals?
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_16=That snowflake light is amazing! It really adds some of that winter atmosphere. How did they get it up here?
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_17=No band is complete without a keyboard. It's not my favorite instrument but it can sure make a melody that my bassline can sync with.
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_18=Now this is where the DJ gets their groove on. It's not my jam, but we all know every successful concert has to make sure the DJ knows what they're doing! I'm sure they'll bring a lot of cheer this holiday.
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_2=Today I followed Tatsuya to a car show. He really likes cars.
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_3=Today I went to lunch with Shirou. I had to make it up to him for getting him in trouble.
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_4=I went to the market today... so I can listen in on people telling each other their secrets!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_5=Once upon a time, someone had a secret package at the docks. And now its mine!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_6=Today I went to the Pinnacle in Griza. They view is actually pretty great when you're not worried about it blowing up!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_7=The stage for the Battle of the Rock is being held at the top of Griza this year! Look at that view!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_8=The entire city is going to be able to hear my kickbutt music from all the way up here!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_9=Can someone come help me get this stage setup?
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_BP=I heard there's a new Booyah Pass out. Don't wait, check it out!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_S_1=Who is that on that beautifully decorated stage? Is that Dasha? I didn't know she could drum!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_S_2=The courier life in Griza is a TOUGH job. Thankfully, I've got Dasha's concert to help me relax!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_S_3=Booyah! It's time to party at the top of Griza!
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_T_1=My relationship with Dasha is tense... she's gotten me in trouble. But she is an amazing punk rocker. I'll give her that.
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_T_2=Trouble always seems to follow me. There's no way any drama happens at the Battle of the Rock... right?
T_37_YY_NEWAGEB_DF_T_3=This is amazing! The music is pure, the light show outstanding and everyone knows how to rock!
